# BeckyMaina-quiz.github.io
This is an application that allows its user to take a short 30 minute quiz.

The quiz is timed by a timer that appears on the top-right side of the screen, a 30min timer that counts down to '0'.

When the timer reaches '0' or all questions are answered then the quiz is over and score is posted.

When the user first loads the application a blue 'Start Quiz' button will be on the page and when clicked questions with multiple choices will appear for the user to answer.

When the user selects an answer to the question displayed then clicks the 'Next Question' button at the bottom, the next question will be displayed. If the user's choice/answer is dimmed 'incorrect' then the application subtracts 3min from the timer.

Once the quiz is over then the user can save their initials and score.

Each question carries (1mark). Calculation of the total is (userscore * 100) to get total in %.
